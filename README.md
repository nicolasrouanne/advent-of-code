# Advent of Code 2023

This is my attempt at the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge.
In each `dayXX` folder there is:

- a `README.md` file with the problem description, copy-pasted from the original website
- an `input.txt` file with the input data
- a `main.rb` file with my solution, which prints the 2 anwers to the console

## Usage

To run the solution for a given day, just run the `main.rb` file in the corresponding folder:

```bash
$ cd day1
$ ruby main.rb
```
